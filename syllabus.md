## Hand written notes

I'll put a link to handwritten notes from the lectures  here

## Class delivery
This class will be delivered via recorded lectures. Instructor office
hours will be held during a subset of course times, as well as others
to accomodate foreign students in different time zones. Course
communication will be held over slack. Invites to the slack group will
be sent over email.

* Recorded lectures (links will be posted here as well as the slack website)
* Slack discussions
* Live instructor office hours
* Live TA office hours
* Weekly projects to be handed in over github classroom
* This github course site
